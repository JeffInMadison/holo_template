holo_template
=============

This is a stashed copy of my Holo everywhere template for StudyBlue's prototype. It is very old and shouldn't be used as many of the components have been updated and are copy pasted into this project. 

ABS isn't really  needed any more and the comap library has a navigation drawer too. The only cool part is the holo everywhere component that will help maintain a holo theme that you can style across your pre-ICS devices. Sometimes I steal layouts from here for my apps otherwise I'd delete it.
